Project Overview 

As we pointed out earlier, the main goal of our project is to create something useful for people. More specifically, in connection with the recent events( a pandemic that lasts more than a year), we wanted to develop a website where people could easily find medicines without any problems. due to the lack of medicines in the city, residents began to crowd in queues without observing the quarantine measures, which led to even more problems. 

The site is also very convenient and helps you not to waste time and immediately find pharmacies where the desired drugs are available. this contributes to quick assistance to those in need and does not violate quarantine measures.

This is a service for finding medicines and medical services in Kazakhstan. We do not sell drugs and do not offer services, but help you quickly find a pharmacy or a place where they are available and at a comfortable price.

Functionality 

Database and web site allows to complete following functions:

    * search for available medicines in pharmacies


Database Design Process

Our basic approach for the database project was to take an existing basic prototype (developed in PHP/mySQL) and optimize the database design. Our goal was to develop it with Oracle and JSP.
