In this regard, we have all witnessed how our medicines and technologies can save and control our lives. Already used to distance learning and work. Everyone knows that there are currently many useful application sites where you can place orders in a few minutes and learn information about food, clothing and technology. Currently in there are practically no websites and applications in our country that everyone can find out information about medicines. Thus, we offer a website based on many drugs, which will use html, css and database to search for drugs and medical devices in our country.

Our project helps people search for and find the medicines they need.
It is a user-friendly and helpful website. It is important for the project that the existing data, so we decided to take existing data from the site, data on medications and pharmacies in each city takes too long, so we decided to take only one city. In addition to collecting data, the project took time. In the future with such an idea such the project can be improved, made large-scale and accessible to all citizens.
