Project description and data preparation
The pandemic has shown that human life and the safety of our family are important in this world. In this regard, we have all witnessed how our medicines and technologies can save and control our lives. Already used to distance learning and work. Everyone knows that there are currently many useful application sites where you can place orders in a few minutes and learn information about food, clothing and technology. Currently in there are practically no websites and applications in our country that everyone can find out information about medicines. Thus, we offer a website based on many drugs, which will use html, css and database to search for drugs and medical devices in our country.
•	Key Terms: Health, Database
● Introduction
Our project helps people search for and find the drugs they need.
It is a user-friendly and helpful website. It is important for the project to have available data, so we decided to take the existing data from the site. There will be useful functions that will be convenient and easy for users to use. In the future, with such an idea, such a project can be improved, made large-scale and accessible to all citizens.
•	Objective: To develop a website that will help residents find
the necessary medicines, medical devices, find out the latest country news and the ability to add new useful information.
